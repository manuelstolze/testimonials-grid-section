## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I'm getting familiar using the CSS Grid layout. I learned how to create a grid layout with multiple rows and columns and how to place items in specific grid areas. This helped me to create a more complex layout with multiple cards and different sections.

Also, I learned more about position relative and absolute in CSS. I used it to position the quotes and the images in the testimonial cards.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp) - This helped me to understand the CSS positioning. I really liked the examples and the explanations.
